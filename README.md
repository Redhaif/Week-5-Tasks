# Week-5-Tasks
IOT Week 5 tasks <br />

This is the README file for week 5 tasks which is creating a text to speach bot using python. <br />
You will find in the folder: <br /> 
1- A public folder that contains the python files. <br />
2- A text file that shows the speech as text. <br />

I have completed all the tasks except for the text to speach task.
I keep getting errors regarding this task, I get this error when I run the program "AttributeError: module 'gtts.tts' has no attribute 'synthesize'".
If I can get a help regarding this problem that would be great.


Thanks for reading. <br />
